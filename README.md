# Project-Deva
This was a conceptual Project regarding the development of the method of reading Devanagari Number Plates and storing it as a Data.
While also able to detect the number plate of Roman characters.

The usage of tools such as,
- PyTessaract (Detecting the nature of lanugage)
- Panda (Working with dataset of Numpy of image for locating the position of Number plate)
- Numpy (Martix form of the image or video feed input through camera)


While it was the group project the development of the working model was within me.
